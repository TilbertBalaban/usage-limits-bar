# Changelog

## v2.0.0 — 2026-09-07

- Added Codex usage from the signed-in ChatGPT account alongside Claude Code
- Added blue and teal Codex rings while preserving the native donut and limit-row layout
- Fetches, errors, and caches are isolated per provider so partial outages degrade gracefully
- Renamed the package, command, cache, LaunchAgent, and repository references to `usage-limits-bar`

## v1.4.1 — 2026-09-04

- Reset times always show minutes ("1:00 AM" instead of "1 AM")

## v1.4.0 — 2026-09-04

- Header buttons reordered: support ($), stats, refresh
- The last successful usage response is cached on disk, so a restart shows data immediately instead of an unknown state
- When there is no data yet and the usage API returns 429, the app retries every minute instead of backing off for five

## v1.3.3 — 2026-09-04

- Refresh icon resized and thinned to match the neighbouring SF Symbols, and rendered as a vector so it is crisp on Retina

## v1.3.2 — 2026-09-04

- Hand-drawn refresh icon centered on its own axis, so the spin animation no longer wobbles (the SF Symbol's arrowhead made it orbit)

## v1.3.1 — 2026-09-04

- Refresh icon spins by swapping in rotated renderings of the symbol instead of rotating the button view, which looked skewed and blurry

## v1.3.0 — 2026-09-04

- Refresh animation: the header refresh icon rotates and the donut and ring gauges spin while data is being fetched, settling back at 12 o'clock when done

## v1.2.3 — 2026-09-04

- Header button hints shown in the header again (instead of tooltips), with a short clear delay so moving between buttons doesn't flash the title

## v1.2.2 — 2026-09-04

- Header button hints are native tooltips only; removed the hover title swap
- The menu no longer rebuilds while open unless data changed, so tooltips and hover state survive refresh ticks

## v1.2.1 — 2026-09-04

- Hovering a header button now shows its hint in the header (AppKit tooltips don't fire inside open menus)

## v1.2.0 — 2026-09-04

- Renamed the package, command, and repository; the menu header was updated to match

## v1.1.1 — 2026-09-04

- Friendly `status` message instead of a traceback when the usage API returns 429

## v1.1.0 — 2026-09-04

- Once-a-day update check against GitHub releases; an "Update available" item appears in the menu when a newer version exists
- Header buttons: usage stats (chart icon) and support ($) with tooltips; removed the text menu items and version line
- Fixed-width warning row so long messages never widen the menu
- Back off for 5 minutes when the usage API returns 429 (manual refresh still fetches immediately)
- Published on PyPI and via the tilbertbalaban/tap Homebrew tap


## v1.0.0 — 2026-09-02

First release.

- macOS menu bar ring gauges: session (5-hour) limit in green and 7-day limit in purple, percent inside, with the session reset countdown next to them
- Dropdown with a large session donut (7-day limit as a thin outer arc) and one row per limit showing "Today 6:10 PM"-style reset times
- Header with refresh and support ($) icon buttons
- Rings turn orange at 80% or on elevated severity, red with `!` at 100%
- Reads the Claude Code OAuth token from the macOS Keychain (falls back to `~/.claude/.credentials.json`), polls `api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` every 60s; the token is sent nowhere else
- Graceful states for missing credentials, expired token, offline, and a rate-limited usage API (keeps last known data)
- `status` subcommand for terminal output, `autostart on|off` for a login LaunchAgent
